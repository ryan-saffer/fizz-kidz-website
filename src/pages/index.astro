                  " My son had the most amazing birthday party at Fizz Kids and it exceeded my expectations by a long shot. Not only did the kids get to make fun and messy creations but the party hosts were sensational. They were so engaging with the kids and kept them involved the entire time, playing games in between each activity which the kids loved. The food package was very generous with lots of options to choose from. All the parents that attended with their kids were very impressed with they way it was run and how great the hosts were with the kids - aged 4-5.  Special thank you to Paddy, who without missing a beat cleaned up my sons 'power spew' as well.  I cannot recommend this party venue enough 😊",

Lots of food and staff were really lovely, accommodating, enthusiastic and engaging with the kids. We had 14 kids plus parents and the space was big enough for that number plus parents. 5th birthday party for 1.5 hours was perfect, with a few younger siblings and the younger ones were entertained as well. Great option to outsource a party that is value for money. Would highly recommended!",
