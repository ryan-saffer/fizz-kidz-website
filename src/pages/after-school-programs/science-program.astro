          <p>
            We are passionate about engaging students in the captivative nature
            of everyday science. The program is designed to enhance children's
            confidence to ask questions, explore through hands-on experiments,
            open-minded to all outcomes, and applaud's innovation. By fostering
            a curiosity about the world we live in, we hope to encourage our
