          Why choose a Fizz Kidz holiday program?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Fizz Kidz holiday programs in Melbourne focus on hands on fun!
          Created by Talia and the entire Fizz Kidz staff, our holiday programs
          aim to be relevant, creative and provide an opportunity for all kids
          to explore and create fabulous creations and products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our holiday programs include dancing games and competitions which get
          the children out of there seats and dancing around the room! Children
          are encouraged to also make new friends and get to know everyone in
          their group, often resulting in them not wanting to leave when getting
          picked up!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our programs are run by our Fizz Kidz certified team who all have a
          working with children's cheque and many of them are first aid trained.
          If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us anytime!
